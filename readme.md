# Spinningup Apple silicon compatible version
This forked version uses gymnasium v27 instead of gym and is compatible with apple silicon(tested on python3.9.16)
Please install tensorflow for apple silicon manually, and run with latest envs described in [gymnasium v27 docs](https://gymnasium.farama.org).

**Also, when you test your policy please explicitly type the env's name with '--env' option.    
(e.g. `python -m spinup.run test_policy data/installtest/installtest_s0 --env LunarLander-v2`)**

**Status:** Maintenance (expect bug fixes and minor updates)

Welcome to Spinning Up in Deep RL! 
==================================

This is an educational resource produced by OpenAI that makes it easier to learn about deep reinforcement learning (deep RL).

For the unfamiliar: [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) (RL) is a machine learning approach for teaching agents how to solve tasks by trial and error. Deep RL refers to the combination of RL with [deep learning](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/).

This module contains a variety of helpful resources, including:

- a short [introduction](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html) to RL terminology, kinds of algorithms, and basic theory,
- an [essay](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/spinningup.html) about how to grow into an RL research role,
- a [curated list](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/keypapers.html) of important papers organized by topic,
- a well-documented [code repo](https://github.com/openai/spinningup) of short, standalone implementations of key algorithms,
- and a few [exercises](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/exercises.html) to serve as warm-ups.
